I like C, I like Linux, and sometimes I wonder what kind of enlightenment one would reach if they knew every detail about how their computer works from the hardware to the highest level. This account looks a bit empty with just one project, so it's time to fill it with open source contributions. How hard can it really be to get a decent Linux kernel commit?

I also do some competitive programming around december, along with Advent of Code. Here's my [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/alvferfue) account.

## Languages

- C is my favorite, simple and elegant.
- C++ is the first language I've ever used to try to build anything serious. I started learning it in 2018 from Youtube videos, and tried to make a limit calculator to solve limit problems in math homework.
- Python, I had some classes in uni using it. I appreciate it when I need to make a quick script, especially dealing with http requests.
- Javascript, I once decided to read through Mozilla tutorials on web development and ended up learning how to use Node to make websites with React.
- Java, I _can_ use it if needed. I've used it with JUnit and JavaFX to contribute to a board game in a group project in uni.
